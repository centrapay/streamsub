## Redis Streams Pubsub Walkthrough

This walkthrough demonstrates the Redis streams commands which are relevant to
implementing pubsub and explains how they are incorporated into StreamSub.
Compared with the official [Redis Streams Intro][], this guide points out some
not-so-clear details related to using Redis streams for pubsub.

The commands should be run in order after starting Redis on the standard port.


### 1. Create consumer group

Unlike streams, Redis stream consumer groups must be created explicitly.
```
scripts/redis-xgroup-create.js stream-1 group-1
```

The StreamSub client can be instructed to create Redis stream consumer groups
for all registered subscribers.

Redis docs: [XGROUP][]


### 2. Add messages to a stream

A sequential message id is automatically assigned by Redis when a message is
added to a stream. Streams are created automatically when the first message is
added.

```
scripts/redis-xadd.js stream-1 msg1
scripts/redis-xadd.js stream-1 msg2
scripts/redis-xadd.js stream-1 msg3
```

Publishers can set a stream's optional max length. StreamSub publishers set a
default max length of "~100".

Redis docs: [XADD][]


### 3. Inspect stream contents

Read all messages with id > 0:
```
scripts/redis-xread.js stream-1 0
```

StreamSub clients do not utilize this operation but it can be useful as a
debugging tool.

Redis docs: [XREAD][]


### 4. Read messages via consumer group

Read two new messages via consumer group:

```
scripts/redis-xreadgroup.js stream-1 group-1 consumer-1 '>' 2
```

Re-read previously delivered, unacknowledged, messages with id greater than
"0". Consumers should do this when starting up in order to recover from a
crash:

```
scripts/redis-xreadgroup.js stream-1 group-1 consumer-1 0
```

Consumer group consumers are created automatically on first read. The special
id ">" matches messages not yet delivered to any consumer. Only messages added
to the stream since the group was created can be consumed via the group.

StreamSub clients, once started and until stopped, continuously attempt to read
messages for all registered subscribers. The consumer id can be configured per
StreamSub client and defaults to the hostname.

Redis docs: [XREADGROUP][]


### 5. Acknowledge a message

A message can no longer be read via the group for which it was acknowledged.

```
scripts/redis-xack.js stream-1 group-1 ${msg_id}
```

StreamSub clients automatically acknowledge processed messages.

Redis docs: [XACK][]


### 6. Find overdue pending messages

The XPENDING command returns information about pending messages for a consumer
group (messages that have been read by a consumer but not acknowledged). The
summary form of XPENDING does not provide any idle time information so it is not
useful for detecting overdue messages but may be useful for debugging.

```
scripts/redis-xpending-summary.js stream-1 group-1
```

The detail form of XPENDING includes message ids and idle time in milliseconds
and returns messages in order of idle time descending. The additional "start
id", "end id" and "count" parameters are required. The special ids "-" and "+"
can be used to indicate lowest and highest ids available.

```
scripts/redis-xpending.js stream-1 group-1 - + 10
```

The XAUTOCLAIM command can be used to easily find and claim overdue pending
messages with a single operation.  XAUTOCLAIM requires Redis 6.2 which is
unreleased as of writing (Jan 2021).

StreamSub clients will periodically use XPENDING to check for pending messages
for each registered subscriber and attempt to claim those that are considered
overdue.

Redis docs: [XPENDING][], [XAUTOCLAIM][]


### 7. Claim overdue messages

Messages can be reassigned to a different consumer (claimed) by calling XCLAIM.
When multiple consumers compete to claim messages only one consumer will
succeed.

```
scripts/redis-xclaim.js stream-1 group-1 consumer-1 120000 ${msg_id}
```

StreamSub clients will automatically attempt to claim pending messages which
appear to be overdue.

Redis docs: [XCLAIM][]


### 8. Inspect consumer status for group

```
scripts/redis-xinfo-consumers.js stream-1 group-1
```

All consumers are listed with pending message count and idle time.

If consumer ids are non-deterministic (eg based on Kubernetes pod name) then
Consumers which are idle for a long time are probably defunct and should be
considered for deletion. Consumer idle time is not reset when reading using ">"
as the message id and no messages were returned. StreamSub clients will
periodically read messages using an id other than ">" to ensure idle time is
updated.

Redis docs: [XINFO][]


### 9. Delete consumer

```
scripts/redis-xgroup-delconsumer.js stream-1 group-1 consumer-2
```

Pending messages associated with a consumer group are effectively acknowledged
when the consumer group is deleted.

StreamSub clients can be instructed to find and delete all consumers which have
been idle for too long.

Redis docs: [XGROUP][]
